function y_nm = sphConvolution(x_nm, h_n)
%SPHCONVOLUTION Performs spherical convolution of function X kernel H
%
%   The convolution of a spherical function x by a spherical filter h can
%   be performed very efficiently on the SH domain. From the filter kernel
%   h, only the m=0 degrees contribute to the output, and anyway it is
%   usually the case that the convolution kernel is axisymmetric, with
%   zero coefficients for m~=0.
%   
%   x_nm: (N+1)^2 coefficients of spherical function x(\theta,\phi)
%
%   h_n:  (N+1) coefficients of axisymmetric spherical kernel function 
%         h(\theta,\phi), with only SH coefficients for m=0 being non-zero.
