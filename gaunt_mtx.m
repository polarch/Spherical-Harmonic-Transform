%GAUNT_MTX Construct a matrix of Gaunt coefficients for complex SHs
%
% GAUNT_MTX constructs the (N1+1)^2x(N2+1)^2x(N+1)^2 matrix of Gaunt 
% coefficients which represent the instegral of three spherical harmonics 
% such as
% G^q_{q',q''} = \int_\Omega Y_{q'}Y_{q''}Y^*_{q} \mathrm{d}\Omega.
%
% With Gaunt coefficients, the spherical harmonic coefficients of the
% product of two spherical functions can be given directly as a linear
% relationship between the harmonic coefficients of the two functions.
